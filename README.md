# Election-Data-Analysis-Project
This project was an Election Data Analysis Project part of the "Python for Data Analysis" Udemy Course for the 2012 Presidential Election
Visualizations created were hoping to solve the following questions using the first dataset pulled from Huff Post:

1.) Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation?

2.) Did the poll results favor Romney or Obama?

3.) How do undecided voters effect the poll?

4.) Can we account for the undecided voters?

5.) How did voter sentiment change over time?

6.) Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?

The second data set was collected and pulled from a .csv file of donor contributions. Questions the visualizations attempted to answer included:

1.) How much was donated and what was the average donation?

2.) How did the donations differ between candidates?

3.) How did the donations differ between Democrats and Republicans?

4.) What were the demographics of the donors?

5.) Is there a pattern to donation amounts?
